# CSO (CloudSaving Organizer)

CSO is a simple Python-based program designed to assist in moving folders from their original source path to a cloud-synced folder and linking the folders from the new location to the old location, so programs can save normally without issues. With this program, files can be synced to the cloud while changes can be sent back and forth without issues. The author recommends using Mega Sync as a sync provider, as mentioned in one of their videos on the @twindenis YouTube channel.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the folder containing the RUN.py file is synced with your cloud provider of choice, it should be a suitable and trustworthy cloud syncing service.
